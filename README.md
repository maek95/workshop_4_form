# workshop_4_form

my own website based on https://www.nordea.se/privat/kundservice/synpunkter-och-forslag.html 
I have added GRID to the form, including two columns, input-fields, radio-boxes, and checkboxes

header does not completely fill the space to the right if you make the screen very small (even though I set it to min-width: 31.25rem like everything else)

Currently I have the set the website to have a min-width of 31.25rem (i.e 500px). This means that when the viewport becomes smaller than this you will be able to scroll to the side to see the rest of the page. NOT MOBILE FIRST????

Best would be to completely change the layout when the screen is smaller... i.e. placed the input boxes below eachother instead of next to eachother (e.g. 'Namn *' and 'Efternamn *')
