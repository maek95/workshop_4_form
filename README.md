# workshop_4_form


Currently I have the set the websit to have a min-width of 31.25rem (16px is set in the html in style.css... so 31.25 * 16 =  500px). This means that when the viewport becomes smaller than this you will be able to scroll to the side to see the rest of the page.

Best would be to completely change the layout when the screen is smaller... i.e. placed the input boxes below eachother instead of next to eachother (e.g. 'Namn *' and 'Efternamn *')
